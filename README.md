# Arc Boosts

üé® Fun stylistic Boosts (extensions) for the Arc Browser

## About

Hi there! This is my public collection of Boosts I've written for the [Arc Browser](https://arc.net). For now, they're only stylistic changes through CSS. As I experiment and write more, that may change. :)

If you like what you find, a ‚≠ê on the repo and/or a follow on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/edwardshturman) would be much appreciated. ‚ù§Ô∏è

## Usage

1. Grab an Arc invite and get set up (not giving them out at the moment üë∫ sorry!).
2. Navigate to a page you'd like to stylize with a Boost I've made, i.e. [GitHub](/github).
3. Click the `+` icon at the bottom-right of the sidebar and hit `New Boost`, then `Style`.
4. Remove the boilerplate code and paste mine. Voil√†!
